        <p>2 Nephi 22:1     And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.</p>
        <p>2 Nephi 22:2     Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation.</p>
        <p>2 Nephi 22:3     Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.</p>
        <p>2 Nephi 22:4     And in that day shall ye say: Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.</p>
        <p>2 Nephi 22:5     Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.</p>
        <p>2 Nephi 22:6     Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.</p>
